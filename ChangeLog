	Cutting release 0.0.5

2024-04-30  Michael Herstine  <sp1ff@pobox.com>

	Fix `inf-coq-prompt-regexp'.
	Prior to this patch, `inf-coq-prompt-regexp' began with "\\b", which
	matches the empty string at the start of a word. This regrettably
	would match any line with a '>' character in it, causing the output
	of Coq evaluation to be extremely confusing.

	This patch changes the "\\b" to "^", meaning that the text must
	begin at the start of the line. `coqtop` seems to indent intermediate
	output, perhaps for this very reason.

	Cut release 0.0.4

2024-04-16  Michael Herstine  <sp1ff@pobox.com>

	Change the default value for `inf-coq-prompt-regexp'...
	This patch will take care of two small housekeeping items:

	    - update the default setting for `inf-coq-prompt-regexp' to
	      better conform to the Coq documents
	    - have `inf-coq-run-coq', when called interactively, pop
	      the new comint buffer to the foreground

	Revamp the algorithm for detecting output is complete.
	This patch changes the way in which `info-coq-send-string' detects
	that output from the most recent text block has completed. It now
	counts the number of periods ('.') in the input, and expects an
	equal number of prompt instances back from the coqtop process.

	Cutting build 0.0.3

2024-04-15  Michael Herstine  <sp1ff@pobox.com>

	[#1] Stop `inf-coq-quit' from prompting.
	When `kill-buffer' is invoked, the hook `kill-buffer-query-functions'
	is run. By default, one function in that hook is
	`process-kill-buffer-query-function' which will, if the buffer has
	an active process, prompt "Buffer NAME has a running process; kill
	it?".

	This patch short-circuits that by setting the coqtop process'
	"query-on-exit-flag" to nil before killing the `inf-coq' comint
	buffer.

	Cutting release 0.0.2

2024-04-09  Michael Herstine  <sp1ff@pobox.com>

	Update `inf-coq-prompt-regexp'.
	This commit does a few things:

	    - Update `inf-coq-prompt-regexp' to reflect that the `coqtop`
	      prompt changes (during proofs, e.g.)
	    - Add an upper limit on the number of times `inf-coq-send-string`
	      will poll the process for output (to prevent infinite loops)
	    - Add an Emacs package to the build

	Also, the source is now linted using:

	    - checkdoc
	    - package-lint

	This commit also contains naming & docstring changes prompted by the
	linters.
