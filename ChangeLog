	[#1] Stop `inf-coq-quit' from prompting.
	When `kill-buffer' is invoked, the hook `kill-buffer-query-functions'
	is run. By default, one function in that hook is
	`process-kill-buffer-query-function' which will, if the buffer has
	an active process, prompt "Buffer NAME has a running process; kill
	it?".

	This patch short-circuits that by setting the coqtop process'
	"query-on-exit-flag" to nil before killing the `inf-coq' comint
	buffer.

	Update `inf-coq-prompt-regexp'.
	This commit does a few things:

	    - Update `inf-coq-prompt-regexp' to reflect that the `coqtop`
	      prompt changes (during proofs, e.g.)
	    - Add an upper limit on the number of times `inf-coq-send-string`
	      will poll the process for output (to prevent infinite loops)
	    - Add an Emacs package to the build

	Also, the source is now linted using:

	    - checkdoc
	    - package-lint

	This commit also contains naming & docstring changes prompted by the
	linters.
